# NextFTC

NextFTC is an advanced and open-source toolkit designed specifically for the First Tech Challenge (FTC) robotics competition. This library provides a comprehensive suite of functionalities that facilitate the development of robust and efficient robot control systems. It aims to simplify the coding process for FTC participants by offering reusable components and intuitive interfaces, making it easier to implement complex robotic behaviors.

NextFTC is built with Kotlin and leverages modern software practices to ensure high performance and reliability. By integrating NextFTC, teams can enhance their robots' capabilities, streamline their development workflows, and focus more on innovation and strategic planning for the competition.

## Installation

#### Install NextFTC using Gradle.

In your project's `build.dependencies.gradle` file, add the following lines to the `repositories` block:

```groovy
maven { url = "https://maven.rowanmcalpin.com/" }
maven { url = "https://maven.brott.dev/" }
maven { url = "https://jitpack.io/" }
```

Next, add the following lines to the `dependencies` block:

```groovy
implementation 'com.rowanmcalpin.nextftc:core:0.1.2'
implementation 'com.acmerobotics.roadrunner:core:0.5.6'
implementation 'com.acmerobotics.dashboard:dashboard:0.4.13'
```

Now, in your TeamCode `build.gradle`, add the following lines to the end of the `dependencies` block:

```groovy
    implementation "org.apache.commons:commons-math3:3.6.1"
    implementation 'com.github.NoahBres:MeepMeep:2.0.3'
```

Finally, sync Gradle. This will add NextFTC, as well as its requirements, RoadRunner, RoadRunner Dashboard, and MeepMeep.
